  "raw_text": "For an average editor, it is not possible or safe to manually remove the __NOINDEX__ tag from a newly created Wikipedia article. The tag is part of a deliberate system to ensure quality control, and attempts to bypass this process are likely to be reverted and may lead to disciplinary action. 🔗\n\nWhy manual removal is not possible or safe\n\n• System-enforced: Wikipedia automatically adds the __NOINDEX__ tag to all new mainspace articles. It is not a simple template that can be deleted. While the tag can be technically edited, the system overrides any non-compliant changes.\n\n• Permissions required: Only experienced volunteer editors with \"new page reviewer\" permissions can manually remove the tag before the automated 90-day period ends. This is a trusted role within the community.\n\n• Discourages spam: The primary purpose of the waiting period is to discourage \"spammy\" or low-quality content from quickly getting high search rankings.\n\n• Risk of deletion: Attempting to force an article to be indexed by circumventing the process is a red flag. If indexed by circumventing the process is a red flag. If",
