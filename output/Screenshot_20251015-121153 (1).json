If the article does not meet Wikipedia's standards, an editor is likely to nominate it for deletion, making it impossible to index.\n\nPenalties for paid editing: If an undisclosed paid editor attempts to remove the tag, the article is even more likely to be flagged for deletion.\n\nThe correct and safe way to expedite indexing\n\nThe only way to have the __NOINDEX__ tag removed early is to create a high-quality article that can be approved by a volunteer editor during the patrol process.\n\n1. Write a high-quality article: Adhere strictly to Wikipedia's notability, neutrality, and sourcing policies. Provide high-quality, reliable, third-party sources to back up all claims.\n\n2. Wait for a new page reviewer: Experienced reviewers with the proper permissions will review the article. If it meets all of Wikipedia's standards, they will remove the __NOINDEX__ tag, and the page will become eligible for indexing.",
