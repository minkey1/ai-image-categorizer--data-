  "raw_text": "Create a stub article\nThe important thing when creating an article is that it contains basic information, otherwise the draft may be deleted without having had a chance to be improved.\n• Start with a definition or description of the topic, which can then serve as an introduction to the article.\n• Identify the boundaries, for example by dates of birth and death, if it is a biography, or location, if it is a place.\n• Add categories to article creation to increase its visibility for project members.\nThen we can:\n• expand on this basic information. Research should provide an outline of the topic. The most important thing is to give, in a few clear and concise sentences, a general overview of the topic and/or the issues it raises;\n• create some links to other articles, which will help the reader to contextualize the subject, failing to have a complete treatment.\nSince a stub is an article like any other in terms of facts, it must respect the founding principles of the encyclopedia, in particular neutrality of point of view . To get started, see also the standard article outlines in Category:Article template , including the example below:\nDetailed help: Project:Biology/Draft taxon plan .\nA section of an existing article can be flagged as empty, insufficiently detailed, or incomplete using the {{...}} template .\nHow to improve a draft?\nRelated article: Help:How to write a good article .\n1. Establish a simple plan that covers the subject: for example, cover the history, how it works, a description of its characteristics (geographical, social, economic), its consequences, etc .;\n2. Find sources to fill each section with content.",
