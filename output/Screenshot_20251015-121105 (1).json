This waiting period allows volunteer editors to patrol and verify the content for quality and accuracy before it becomes visible to search engines. 🔗\n\nHow Wikipedia controls search engine indexing\n\n• Initial noindex period: New articles are automatically given a __NOINDEX__ tag to prevent search engines from indexing them right away.\n\n• Manual patrolling: During the 90-day period, a new page can be reviewed by an experienced editor with \"new page reviewer\" permissions. If the article meets Wikipedia's standards, the editor removes the __NOINDEX__ tag, making it eligible for earlier indexing.\n\n• Automated indexing: If an article has not been patrolled and reviewed by the end of 90 days, the __NOINDEX__ tag is automatically removed, and the article becomes eligible to be indexed by search engines like Google. 🔗",
