The statement “his parents hit him thereofre he is manner less” is being presented as the only explanation (also the explaination isn’t that psychologically neat and oversimplyfied, which is even sad to see coming from a psychologist), and “as therapist”, that adds a layer of authority that makes it even more problematic. There can be so many other possible explanations behavioural, neurodevelopmental, autism spectrum-related, conduct and more. Even if she’s referring to someone else’s post, the way it’s framed is still misleading. I rarely call people out because the field of mental health isn’t black and white, mistakes happen, especially in opinion-based content. But when professionals use their credibility to turn opinions into facts and make sweeping claims like this that too oversimolified and not even psychologically that approproate, it can easily misinform a massive audience. Please be careful if you ever encounter emotionally charged opinion based content online irrespective of the qualification, achievements or number of follwers.",
