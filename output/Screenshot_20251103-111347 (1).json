It caught my eye because it perfectly reflects what I've been observing for the longest time.\nReligion or beliefs are personal choices - I have no issues with anyone practising them, as long as they're able to keep their beliefs and logic intact, without letting the former override the latter.\nThe statement \"No one is responsible, it was an act of God\" is a way of dodging accountability by placing the blame on something unknown to us.\nReligion or beliefs, in our country (and elsewhere too), are often used as umbrellas to shield oneself from wrongdoings. Isn't that convenient?\nI wish it were different. I wish, instead of using beliefs as an umbrella to protect themselves, people could use them as a driving force to do better - to be better.",
